<h1>BalanceBringer</h1>

<h2>Brings balance to the game</h2>
<h3>(because Mojang apparently can't)</h3>

<h4>This plugin is purely for <a href="https://purpur.pl3x.net/">purpur</a> servers.</h4>

<p>
BalanceBringer allows you to bring balance by removing mending enchantment or adjusting it, toggling if villagers should be able to trade it, or, for that matter if villagers should exist at all. Plugin includes multitude of options for you to tinker around with and bring your own balance.
